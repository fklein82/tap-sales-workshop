**Important**: 
- For the next sections, it is vital that you  make sure to sign-in to cloud.vmware.com with your **@vmware.com** email address and select the **"Tanzu End to End"** organization. Please be careful not to alter the services or configurations of the clusters in these environments as they are shared for the entire End to End Demo Environment.
- The VMware Application Catalog subscription applied in the **"Tanzu End to End"** organization does not allow to generate OCI artefacts. This is a demo environment

**VMware Application Catalog**, or **VAC** is formerly known as **Tanzu Application Catalog**. **VMware Application Catalog** is a **customizable** library of **trusted**, pre-packaged open-source application components that can be **built-to-spec**, are **continously maintained** and **verifiably tested for use in production** environments.

Enterprises can consume and deploy trusted and updated applications from a catalog tailored to their needs. This catalog is distributed through a private repository to internal customers.

**Important**: For the next sections, we will assume the customer has a valid subscription and is able to add its own registry into VMware Application Catalog.

To be able to use VMware Application Platform properly, few steps have to be done :
1. Login to VMware Marketplace with a valid VMware Application Catalog Subscription.
2. Add an Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant registry.
3. Create application.
4. Use your application.

###### Login to VMware Marketplace
VMware Application Catalog is part of the VMware Marketplace website, when you are logged into the marketplace inside your organization, you will see this menu :
